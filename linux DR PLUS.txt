Operating system is a system software which acts as a interface between user and
computer.
why do we use Windows 10 mostly? 
because it is user friendly
major differnece between os is versions.

windows is closed source OS
linux is open source OS
We have different versions of OS .Few commands are updated

In DEVOPS why we need OS?
Devops is common for every cloud.But why we need Linux OS?Windows is not having security
and no rules and closed source
But Linux and CentOs are open source and secure.
For using DEVOPS we are using linux commands only.
Os is used as GUI and CLI:
GUI-Graphical user interface-->You can see the images
CLI-Command line interface-->you use commands.
No one use windows in software industry.They use linux.
We have to give commands in linux.

Operating Systems:
These are based on linux:
CentOs
fedora
ubuntu
kali linux--for ethical hacking--we dont know from where the data is coming and
where data is sent


where we learn linux commands?
To learn linux commands we have to install virtual machine
Difference between virtual and physical is physical means you can touch
but virtual you cannot touch
Inside windows we can install VMWARE
VMWARE is also a machine where we can manage any operating systems at a time
In the VMWAre we can create a windows,redhat,centos,ubuntu os etc.
In the virtual machine we can increase the RAM by using options
But in physical machine if we have 4GB ram then buy another 4GB ram and remove screws
and insert ram in the machine
Different VMWARE are available ,all works same.
Some softwares will run only in older versions for that purpose also we use VMWARE.
**press start button to turn on virtual machine

To create a virtual machine of REdhat OS:

go to new
give name-->next
go to ram-->give 4 GB-->
harddisk-->next
now when you start the OS-->nothing will happen because we didnt give OS image.
so now select the disk then it will load
So now we are using two operating systems

What cloud provides?
cloud providers will provide a virtual PC's
AWS will provide virtual PC's
In Technical hub nearly 100 employees are there --work from home
How can the employees share their work?
so they make use of AWS.
AWS will provide virtual PCs
Cloud providers will help us to create new features.

Open virtual machine:
cd directoryname-->to change directory
cd ..          to come out of desktop
ls              list information of files.
cat filename      to open a file
mkdir filename    


LINUX intro
basic commands
What is VMWARE
LINUX installation
vi commands and what is the use
Difference between user and Graphical interface
File permissions 
Disk permission or Disk creating

IP ADDRESS CLASS AND RANGES:
1-127 -A

127 is loop back ip address
whetther my network is working properly or not
128-191-B
192-223-C
224-239-D
240-255-E

D-DEVELOPMENT AND RESEARCH
E-GOVT PURPOSE
C-PUBLIC IP
B-SMALL INDUSTRIES
A-sMALL INDUSTRIES

PING COMMAND:
THERE are some pc's in computer labs
how pc's get network
you will have iron box-and some switches are there-it is the network device
these switches are connected to pc's
now this network device is connected to router in server room
we will get network to router from BSNL
now router will change the public ip to private ip
this BSNL will be directly given to towers from towers we will get network in our mobile

suppose dlink network is there
and pc's are connected to dlink

ping command is used to check connectivity between our network to another network
test DNS name resolution server
test network interface card

once ping google.com is given it will go to college server and checks whether it is giving access to google.com
if it is giving access then we will get reply

ping google.com means ping at a ip address of google

for google.com users will get diff ip address because millions of people will access then load balance will increase
so if cloud is increased then devops engineer should divide users on different sub servers

for cpu backside or pc we have a network port which will communicate with network interface card

Reasons for packet loss:

network congestion
faulty hardware
firewall issues
destination host unreachable

two types of ip address

automatically connected ip address
manual ip address

some applications will run on some network only

127 series will check whether  network interface card working properly or not
